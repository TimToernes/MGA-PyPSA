## Example of linear optimal power flow with coupling to heating sector
#
#In this example three locations are optimised, each with an electric bus and a heating bus and corresponding loads. At each location the electric and heating buses are connected with heat pumps; heat can also be supplied to the heat bus with a boiler. The electric buses are connected with transmission lines and there are electrical generators at two of the nodes.
